**PlantDoc: A Dataset for Visual Plant Disease Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 2482 images with 8595 labeled objects belonging to 29 different classes including *Corn leaf blight*, *Tomato Septoria leaf spot*, *Squash Powdery mildew leaf*, and other: *Raspberry leaf*, *Potato leaf early blight*, *Corn rust leaf*, *Tomato leaf late blight*, *Peach leaf*, *Blueberry leaf*, *Tomato leaf bacterial spot*, *Potato leaf late blight*, *Strawberry leaf*, *Apple Scab Leaf*, *Apple leaf*, *Apple rust leaf*, *Tomato Early blight leaf*, *Tomato mold leaf*, *Tomato leaf yellow virus*, *Tomato leaf*, *grape leaf*, *Corn Gray leaf spot*, *Bell_pepper leaf spot*, *Soyabean leaf*, *grape leaf black rot*, *Bell_pepper leaf*, *Cherry leaf*, *Tomato leaf mosaic virus*, *Potato leaf*, and *Tomato two spotted spider mites leaf*.

Images in the PlantDoc dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (231 images) and *train* (2251 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/).
